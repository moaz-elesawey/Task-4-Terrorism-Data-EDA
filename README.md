# Task 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis EDA on Terrorism Data

**Key Insights**


> From the first image above we can see a very high increase in the number of terrior attacks between the 2010 and 2017 with approximitly 3500 terrior event increase each year. We also can see that the terrior events starts to decrease after 2014 but it still very high compared to the pervious year from 1970 till 2004.

> When we investigate more and calculate the number of attacks at each country we can see that most of the attacks happend mostly in 4 country which are (Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India). After we look at the number of Terrior attacks at each Regions we also see that it's mostly located in Middle East & North Africa with nearly 50K attacks happend.

> If we investigate more on the number of attacks at each country and each year we see that is mostly located at Iraq around the 2012 till 2017. When we check the same thiing but for the region not the country we see also that is mostly located in middle east between also 2012 till 2017 which does make sense as Iraq is located in middle east.

> We also can see that most of the Terrior Attacks are done using Explosive & Firearms.

**Notes**

> Something that got my attention is the use of Radiological & Biological Weapons in Terrior Attacks. which is something very insane and very crul for a human to do.
